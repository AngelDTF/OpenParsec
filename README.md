OpenParsec is a simple Parsec client written in Swift using the SwiftUI framework and the ParsecSDK.

This project is still a major WIP, so apologies for the currently lackluster documentation. I'm also very new to both Swift and SwiftUI so I'm sure there are many places for improvement.

Before building, make sure you have the Parsec SDK framework symlinked or copied to the `Frameworks` folder. Builds were tested on Xcode Version 12.5.
